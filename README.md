# vigilance_jira_autocreate
A Simply code to autocreate jira's issue with Vigilance (Vigil@nce) vulnerability bulletin. 
this is functionnal with a Vigilance functionnal account : https://vigilance.fr/ and a Jira On Premise installation. 
I will add a CRON task to create every day (without week-end) when it's possible.
